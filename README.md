# **My Java Repository: Laboratory Activities, Midterm, & Final Outputs**

This repository contains a collection of Java programs developed as laboratory activities, as well as a midterm laboratory exam and a final group project in the Computer Science course. The projects demonstrate fundamental Java concepts, from basic console applications to GUI-based programs using AWT and Swing, including data input, calculations, conditional logic, and simple application development.

## **Lab Activity 1: Employee Information System**

This Java program is a basic Employee Information System that simulates collecting personal and work-related input from the user, as well as calculating the employee's daily salary. This program was created for a laboratory activity.

## **Lab Activity 2: Employee Information System (Part 2\)**

This Java program is an enhanced version of the previous basic Employee Information System. Apart from collecting personal and work-related input from the user, it now also provides a more comprehensive salary breakdown, including daily, weekly, monthly, gross yearly, and net yearly salaries. It also calculates the employee's years until retirement. This program was created for a laboratory activity.

## **Lab Activity 3: Employee Information System with Conditional Statements**

This Java program is an advanced version of the previously created Employee Information Systems. This program incorporates conditional statements, specifically if-else and switch cases for input validation. It collects detailed employee information, as well as providing a comprehensive salary breakdown, which includes conditional tax deductions based on the employee’s income. This program was created for a laboratory activity.

## **Lab Activity 4: Employee Information System GUI**

This Java program is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application built using Java's Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT). It allows users to input employee information (first name, last name, age, hours worked per day, and hourly rate) and calculates their daily salary. The application includes basic input validation to ensure all fields are filled and that numerical inputs are valid. This program was created for a laboratory activity.

## **Lab Activity 5: Quiz Application AWT**

This Java program implements a simple multiple-choice quiz application with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT). The quiz presents a series of questions, allows the user to select an answer from provided options, and tracks the score. At the end of the quiz, it displays the final score. This program was created for a laboratory activity.

## **Lab Activity 6: Swing To-Do List Application**

This Java program creates a simple To-Do List application with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using Java Swing. It allows users to add new tasks, including a task name, description, and status. The tasks are displayed in a table, providing a clear overview of all pending and completed items. This program was created for a laboratory activity.

## **My Midterm Lab Exam: IT Ticket Processing System**

This Java program simulates a basic IT ticket processing system. It allows users to add new tickets, update their statuses, view all existing tickets, and generate a summary report. The system uses arrays to store ticket information and includes input validation to ensure data integrity. This program was created as a midterm laboratory exam.

## **Final Group Project: Calculator Application**

This program contains a simple yet functional calculator application built using Java Swing. It provides standard arithmetic operations, a calculation history, and a theme toggle for a personalized user experience.
