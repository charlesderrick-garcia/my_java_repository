# **Lab Activity 4: Employee Information System GUI**

This Java program is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application built using Java's Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT). It allows users to input employee information (first name, last name, age, hours worked per day, and hourly rate) and calculates their daily salary. The application includes basic input validation to ensure all fields are filled and that numerical inputs are valid. This program was created for a laboratory activity.

## **Features**

* **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Provides an interactive window for data input rather than console prompts.  
* **User Input Fields:** Dedicated text fields for first name, last name, age, hours worked, and hourly rate.  
* **Input Validation:**  
  * Checks if all input fields are filled.  
  * Validates that age is a valid integer.  
  * Validates that hours worked and hourly rate are valid numbers.  
* **Daily Salary Calculation:** Computes the daily salary based on valid hours worked and hourly rate.  
* **Formatted Output:** Displays the employee's full name, age, and daily salary in a dedicated output area, with the salary formatted to two decimal places.  
* **Error Handling:** Provides user-friendly error messages for invalid or incomplete inputs.

## **How to Compile and Run**

To compile and run this Java AWT application, follow these steps:

1. **Save the file:** Save the code as LabActivity4EmpInfoSystemGUI.java.  
2. **Open a terminal or command prompt.**  
3. **Navigate to the directory** where you saved the file.  
4. **Compile the Java code.**  
5. **Run the compiled program.**
